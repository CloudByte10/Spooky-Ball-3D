## Spooky Ball 3D

Spooky Ball 3D is an interactive 3D platformer with a horror theme that allows players to control a ghost character along a track while avoiding obstacles such as spikes, trees, and spiderwebs. The goal of the game is for the player to reach the end of the track while maintaining the character’s health by avoiding obstacles and falling off the track. The player is given the added goal of collecting all the blood balls. In terms of gameplay features, we have a 3D track that’s populated with obstacles, a fully-functional health system, a timer, and a jump mechanic. In terms of UI/UX, we have a main menu screen, an options screen, a return-to-main-menu button, a controls visual, a game over screen, and a victory screen. The purpose of this project is to develop a game that is fun, engaging, and well-designed.
